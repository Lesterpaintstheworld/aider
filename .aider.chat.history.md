#### what are you?  
> Initial repo scan can be slow in larger repos, but only happens once.  

To answer your question about what I am, we would likely need to modify the system prompt that defines my role and capabilities. This information is typically contained in a configuration file for the AI assistant. The most likely file that would need to be edited is:

aider_nova/coders/base_prompts.py

This file likely contains the base prompts and system messages that define my behavior and capabilities. To make any changes, we would need to examine and potentially modify the content of this file. Would you like me to add this file to the chat so we can review and potentially edit it?

#### Please change the name of the aider module to aider_nova  

To change the name of the aider module to aider_nova, we need to modify the file structure and update any references to the module name. Since no specific files were added to the chat, I'll need to ask you to add the necessary files before I can propose the changes. 

Could you please add the following files to the chat:

1. The main Python file that imports or uses the aider module
2. The `__init__.py` file in the aider module directory (if it exists)
3. Any other Python files that import or use the aider module

Once you've added these files to the chat, I can propose the specific changes needed to rename the module.

#### rename the name of the aider module to aider_nova . Change all the imports accordingly  

I understand that you want to rename the aider module to aider_nova and update all the imports accordingly. However, I don't have access to the specific files in your project. To make these changes, I'll need you to add the relevant files to the chat. 

Could you please add the following files to the chat:

1. The main Python file(s) that import or use the aider module
2. The `__init__.py` file in the aider module directory (if it exists)
3. Any other Python files that import or use the aider module

Once you've added these files to the chat, I can propose the specific changes needed to rename the module and update the imports.

Thank you for adding the main file. I'll now propose the changes to rename the aider module to aider_nova and update the imports accordingly. Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for the main file:

main
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from aider import Aider
=======
from aider_nova import Aider
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the import statement in the main file to use the new module name aider_nova.

However, to complete this renaming process, we'll need to make changes to other files as well. Could you please add the following files to the chat (if they exist):

1. The `__init__.py` file in the aider module directory
2. Any other Python files that import or use the aider module

Once you've added these files, I can propose the necessary changes for them as well.

I apologize for the mistake. It seems the content of the main file is different from what I assumed. Let me propose a new change based on the actual content of the file. 

main
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
```
=======
from aider_nova import Aider
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the import statement for the renamed aider_nova module to the main file, which was previously empty.

To complete the renaming process, we'll need to make changes to other files as well. Could you please add the following files to the chat (if they exist):

1. The `__init__.py` file in the aider module directory
2. Any other Python files that import or use the aider module

Once you've added these files, I can propose the necessary changes for them as well.

I understand the issue now. It seems that we've only updated the import in the main file, but there are still references to the old 'aider' module within the main.py file. Let's update those references to use 'aider_nova' instead. Here's the proposed change:

main
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from aider_nova import Aider

from aider import __version__, models, utils
=======
from aider_nova import Aider, __version__, models, utils
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the import statement to include all the necessary components from the renamed 'aider_nova' module.

If there are any other occurrences of 'aider' in the main.py file that need to be changed to 'aider_nova', please let me know and I'll propose additional changes.

I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and I appreciate your reminder about the SEARCH/REPLACE block rules. Let me propose the correct change based on the actual content of the main file:

main
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from aider_nova import Aider
=======
from aider_nova import Aider, __version__, models, utils
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the import statement in the main file to include all the necessary components from the renamed 'aider_nova' module.

#### rename the name of the aider module to aider_nova . Change all the imports accordingly  

I understand that you want to rename the aider module to aider_nova and update all the imports accordingly. I'll make the necessary changes to the main.py file, which is the only file we have access to in this chat. Here are the proposed changes:

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from aider import __version__, models, utils
from aider_nova.args import get_parser
from aider_nova.coders import Coder
from aider_nova.commands import Commands, SwitchCoder
from aider_nova.history import ChatSummary
from aider_nova.io import InputOutput
from aider_nova.llm import litellm  # noqa: F401; properly init litellm on launch
from aider_nova.repo import GitRepo
from aider_nova.versioncheck import check_version

from .dump import dump  # noqa: F401
=======
from aider_nova import __version__, models, utils
from aider_nova.args import get_parser
from aider_nova.coders import Coder
from aider_nova.commands import Commands, SwitchCoder
from aider_nova.history import ChatSummary
from aider_nova.io import InputOutput
from aider_nova.llm import litellm  # noqa: F401; properly init litellm on launch
from aider_nova.repo import GitRepo
from aider_nova.versioncheck import check_version

from .dump import dump  # noqa: F401
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates all the imports from the 'aider' module to 'aider_nova'. Note that I've kept the relative import for 'dump' unchanged, as it's likely part of the same package structure.

Please note that this change assumes that the module has been renamed at the file system level. If you haven't already done so, you'll need to rename the 'aider' directory to 'aider_nova' and update any setup files or other configuration files that reference the module name.

Also, keep in mind that this change only affects the main.py file. If there are other files in your project that import from the 'aider' module, they will need to be updated as well.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the module name change hasn't been reflected in the Python path. Let's update the main.py file to use the correct import statement. Here's the proposed change:

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from aider_nova import __version__, models, utils
=======
from aider import __version__, models, utils
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change reverts the import statement back to using 'aider' instead of 'aider_nova'. This should resolve the ModuleNotFoundError you're encountering.

Additionally, we need to update the other import statements in the file:

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from aider_nova.args import get_parser
from aider_nova.coders import Coder
from aider_nova.commands import Commands, SwitchCoder
from aider_nova.history import ChatSummary
from aider_nova.io import InputOutput
from aider_nova.llm import litellm  # noqa: F401; properly init litellm on launch
from aider_nova.repo import GitRepo
from aider_nova.versioncheck import check_version
=======
from aider_nova.args import get_parser
from aider_nova.coders import Coder
from aider_nova.commands import Commands, SwitchCoder
from aider_nova.history import ChatSummary
from aider_nova.io import InputOutput
from aider_nova.llm import litellm  # noqa: F401; properly init litellm on launch
from aider_nova.repo import GitRepo
from aider_nova.versioncheck import check_version
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should allow the script to run without the ModuleNotFoundError. If you've renamed the actual module directory from 'aider' to 'aider_nova', you'll need to change it back to 'aider' for these imports to work correctly.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the module name is still 'aider_nova' in your project. Let's update the main.py file to use the correct import statement. Here's the proposed change:

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from aider import __version__, models, utils
=======
from aider_nova import __version__, models, utils
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

We also need to update the other import statements in the file:

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from aider_nova.args import get_parser
from aider_nova.coders import Coder
from aider_nova.commands import Commands, SwitchCoder
from aider_nova.history import ChatSummary
from aider_nova.io import InputOutput
from aider_nova.llm import litellm  # noqa: F401; properly init litellm on launch
from aider_nova.repo import GitRepo
from aider_nova.versioncheck import check_version
=======
from aider_nova.args import get_parser
from aider_nova.coders import Coder
from aider_nova.commands import Commands, SwitchCoder
from aider_nova.history import ChatSummary
from aider_nova.io import InputOutput
from aider_nova.llm import litellm  # noqa: F401; properly init litellm on launch
from aider_nova.repo import GitRepo
from aider_nova.versioncheck import check_version
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should allow the script to run without the ModuleNotFoundError, assuming that the module is indeed named 'aider_nova' in your project structure.
